## **About me**
I am a sophomore studying Computer Science at UC San Diego, and I have a personal interest in computer architecture and cybersecurity. I'm all about understanding how computers work from the ground up and keeping them safe from hackers. It's a lot like solving puzzles for me—figuring out the best way to build a system and then making sure it's secure. I spend my days diving into the technical stuff, learning how to outsmart security threats, and building better, stronger systems.
