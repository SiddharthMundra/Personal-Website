I'm an undergraduate student at UC San Diego majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Finance with a passion for software development. My experience relies in fields including Web Development, Software Development, Machine Learning, Computer Architecture and App Development. I like figuring out how to save time by automating processes, and creating efficient and scalable solutions.

I’m always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate on innovative projects. be it building a new application from scratch, optimizing existing systems, or exploring the latest advancements in technology, I’m dedicated to continuous learning and improvement. Should you have any questions about my projects, feel free to connect with me over email anytime!


## Projects
### 1. SpeedStatAI – Machine Learning Classifier


- 


### 2. Virtualis Nutrix (online nurse) – Mobile Application
- It was prime lockdown, and the elderly in my area were facing a challenge. The elderly in India are very dependent on domestic helpers for things like getting medicine on time, getting adequate water in a day, eating food on time, time to sleep. However they were not allowed to come for work during the lockdown. Then, I decided to go ahead and create a very easy-to-use app for them; it featured an extremely basic UI which is very easy to use, and it has features like setting a medicine reminder, drink water reminders, and integrating the app into the phone’s vanilla calendar as well as clock app so everything would sync perfectly.
- Developed mobile application with Flutter and Dart to assist the elderly in my community during the lockdown using Android Studio
- Engineered a secure backend using Google Firebase for data storage and real-time data synchronization. Ensured user data security by implementing a secure login system for individual cloud-based data storage as well as two factor authentication
- Established CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployments, ensuring code quality with Gitlab


### 3. QUADspeaker – Twitter Bot
- During the summer of 2025, I kept seeing videos about influencers explaining "passive income" methods to teenagers, and the most common one was posting on twitter/youtube. Having a lot of free time on my hand, I thought to myself why not try it. That is when I decided to create my own twitter bot, try and personalise the news ot attract more viewers and include relevant hashtags as well.
- Developed a Twitter bot using the Tweepy API to automatically post the latest news stories from four sources, including CNN, BBC and Al-Jazeera; posting 50 times a day with tailored, user-engaging content
- Integrated OpenAI API to paraphrase and enhance the appeal of news headlines, ensuring engaging and dynamic content for daily posting, incorporating error handling and logging for efficient web scraping and image management
- Employed Python’s schedule library to manage regular execution of news scraping, tweeting, and daily summaries, ensuring timely and consistent updates while maintaining robust tracking of posted content and images to prevent duplication


## Experience
### 1. KRG Lab (Professor Ryan Kastner) Research Assistant
- Engineered a 91% accuracy NLP model to verify any Indian government-issued identity.
- Developed a robust anti-forgery application utilizing computer vision technologies and libraries including DocTR, TensorFlow, Keras.
- Leveraged ngrok for secure tunneling to ensure safe communication between the API and the script.
- Conducted comprehensive testing of the application by designing and implementing an API with Postman, employing advanced techniques such as pixel analysis, metadata verification, colol 
  consistency checks, steganography detection, and noise consistency evaluation.


### 2. Software Development Intern - Cumulus Systems, Hitachi India

### 2. Software Development Intern - Cumulus Systems, Hitachi India
- Automated the analysis of log reports to pinpoint errors within the Measure Analyze Recommend Solve (MARS) tool, a high-performance analytics engine.
- Ensured high code sustainability and future scalability by utilizing debugging and version control tools (GIT) extensively.
- Used the POSIX Regular Expressions Library along with Apache POI to write 1000+ lines of code which can read 15,000+ log files, producing detailed MS Excel visualizations identifying trend 
  irregularities.
- Leveraged agile methodologies to drive the iterative development process.
- Contributed to the design and implementation of advanced error detection algorithms, improving the accuracy and efficiency of log analysis by 20% and troubleshooting time by 15%.
