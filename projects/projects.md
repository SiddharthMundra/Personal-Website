## Projects
### 1. SpeedStatAI – Machine Learning Classifier


- 


### 2. Virtualis Nutrix (online nurse) – Mobile Application
- It was prime lockdown, and the elderly in my area were facing a challenge. The elderly in India are very dependent on domestic helpers for things like getting medicine on time, getting adequate water in a day, eating food on time, time to sleep. However they were not allowed to come for work during the lockdown. Then, I decided to go ahead and create a very easy-to-use app for them; it featured an extremely basic UI which is very easy to use, and it has features like setting a medicine reminder, drink water reminders, and integrating the app into the phone’s vanilla calendar as well as clock app so everything would sync perfectly.
- Developed mobile application with Flutter and Dart to assist the elderly in my community during the lockdown using Android Studio
- Engineered a secure backend using Google Firebase for data storage and real-time data synchronization. Ensured user data security by implementing a secure login system for individual cloud-based data storage as well as two factor authentication
- Established CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployments, ensuring code quality with Gitlab


### 3. QUADspeaker – Twitter Bot
- During the summer of 2025, I kept seeing videos about influencers explaining "passive income" methods to teenagers, and the most common one was posting on twitter/youtube. Having a lot of free time on my hand, I thought to myself why not try it. That is when I decided to create my own twitter bot, try and personalise the news ot attract more viewers and include relevant hashtags as well.
- Developed a Twitter bot using the Tweepy API to automatically post the latest news stories from four sources, including CNN, BBC and Al-Jazeera; posting 50 times a day with tailored, user-engaging content
- Integrated OpenAI API to paraphrase and enhance the appeal of news headlines, ensuring engaging and dynamic content for daily posting, incorporating error handling and logging for efficient web scraping and image management
- Employed Python’s schedule library to manage regular execution of news scraping, tweeting, and daily summaries, ensuring timely and consistent updates while maintaining robust tracking of posted content and images to prevent duplication
