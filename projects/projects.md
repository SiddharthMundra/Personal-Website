## Projects
### 1. SpeedStatAI – Machine Learning Classifier
**Reason:** This summer, while watching the Belgian GP, I thought to myself - “I wonder how F1 has developed its analytics tool to perfectly predict pitstop laps as well as timings; is it purely based on historical data?”. With a lot of free time on my hands, I decided to try and implement one myself. 

Using my skills in machine learning and data analysis, I embarked on a project to develop an analytics tool that predicts pitstop strategies. I gathered historical race data, tire degradation patterns, and real-time weather conditions to train my model. The process not only deepened my understanding of F1 analytics but also honed my abilities in data science and algorithm development. [Link](https://github.com/SiddharthMundra/SpeedStatAI)

- Developed an optimized algorithm using Pandas for automated data collection from Formula 1 racing databases, for 10,000+ statistics
- Trained a KNeighborsClassifier with scikit-learn to predict qualifying positions and race winners for the 2024 season
- Integrated Django with React to build a dynamic web application that allows users to forecast qualifying results and race outcomes based on the classifier’s predictions.
- Generated over 500 API endpoints using Django Rest Framework to present predictions for F1 races and qualifying sessions, including weather-related factors.


### 2. Virtualis Nutrix (online nurse)
**Reason:** It was prime lockdown, and the elderly in my area were facing a challenge. The elderly in India are very dependent on domestic helpers for things like getting medicine on time, getting adequate water in a day, eating food on time, time to sleep. However they were not allowed to come for work during the lockdown. 

I decided to go ahead and create a very easy-to-use app for them; it featured an extremely basic UI which is very easy to use, and it has features like setting a medicine reminder, drink water reminders, and integrating the app into the phone’s vanilla calendar as well as clock app so everything would sync perfectly.

- Developed mobile application with Flutter and Dart to assist the elderly in my community during the lockdown using Android Studio
- Engineered a secure backend using Google Firebase for data storage and real-time data synchronization
- Ensured user data security by implementing a secure login system for individual cloud-based data storage as well as two factor authentication
- Established CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployments, ensuring code quality with Gitlab


### 3. QUADspeaker – Twitter Bot
**Reason:** During the summer of 2025, I kept seeing videos about influencers explaining "passive income" methods to teenagers, and the most common one was posting on twitter/youtube. Having a lot of free time on my hand, I thought to myself why not try it. That is when I decided to create my own twitter bot, try and personalise the news ot attract more viewers and include relevant hashtags as well. [Link](https://github.com/SiddharthMundra/QUADspeaker)

- Developed a Twitter bot using the Tweepy API to automatically post the latest news stories from four sources, including CNN, BBC and Al-Jazeera; posting 50 times a day with tailored, user-engaging content
- Integrated OpenAI API to paraphrase and enhance the appeal of news headlines, ensuring engaging and dynamic content for daily posting, incorporating error handling and logging for efficient web scraping and image management
- Employed Python’s schedule library to manage regular execution of news scraping, tweeting, and daily summaries, ensuring timely and consistent updates while maintaining robust tracking of posted content and images to prevent duplication


### 4. Developer Journal (logger)
**Reason:** During Spring 2024, I was made a co-lead for a software engineering class. I was co-leading 11 people; I had to do various tasks such as conduct spring meetings, code review, conduct standup meetings, design the CI/CD pipeline as well as help develop the frontend and backend. It was a pretty fun experience; I learned that software engineering is not just coding, coding is just about 20% of it :). Our project stood out among 35 groups, placing in the top 3 of the class. The success was marked by our website video being showcased during the class presentation. [Link](https://github.com/SiddharthMundra/Developer-Journal)


- Developed a developer-journal; a logger where you can write what you worked on; it is automatically saved 
- Full-stack web application using HTML, CSS, JS, as well as React
- Fully operational CI/CD pipeline with E2E testing, dry run testing, Unit testing
- Employed GIT actions (such as needing approval from leader's before merging and getting code quality review)
