## Experience
### 1. KRG Lab (Professor Ryan Kastner) Research Assistant
- Engineered a 91% accuracy NLP model to verify any Indian government-issued identity.
- Developed a robust anti-forgery application utilizing computer vision technologies and libraries including DocTR, TensorFlow, Keras.
- Leveraged ngrok for secure tunneling to ensure safe communication between the API and the script.
- Conducted comprehensive testing of the application by designing and implementing an API with Postman, employing advanced techniques such as pixel analysis, metadata verification, colol 
  consistency checks, steganography detection, and noise consistency evaluation.

### 2. Software Development Intern - Cumulus Systems, Hitachi India
- Automated the analysis of log reports to pinpoint errors within the Measure Analyze Recommend Solve (MARS) tool, a high-performance analytics engine.
- Ensured high code sustainability and future scalability by utilizing debugging and version control tools (GIT) extensively.
- Used the POSIX Regular Expressions Library along with Apache POI to write 1000+ lines of code which can read 15,000+ log files, producing detailed MS Excel visualizations identifying trend 
  irregularities.
- Leveraged agile methodologies to drive the iterative development process.
- Contributed to the design and implementation of advanced error detection algorithms, improving the accuracy and efficiency of log analysis by 20% and troubleshooting time by 15%.
